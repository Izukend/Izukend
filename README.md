### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my project P-Zone with my team
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tailwindcss and next.js
- âš¡Fun fact: I love coffee because I'm a student in IT! It's the perfect fuel for those late-night coding sessions and debugging marathons. Plus, it helps me stay focused and alert while tackling complex programming problems.
