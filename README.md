### Hi there 👋

# English

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio and my project C02mon  with my team
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tailwindcss
- ⚡Fun fact: I love coffee because I'm a student in IT! It's the perfect fuel for those late-night coding sessions and debugging marathons. Plus, it helps me stay focused and alert while tackling complex programming problems.
